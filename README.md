## context-free

One of the most incredible pieces of software I've found during 2000s. At those times it was 
inseparable from notion of computational design (along with VVVV and processing). 
It allows you to generate vector images from context-free design grammars. It's a completely 
different mindset from conventional imperative programming. It is the case when program 
and it's output, both are pieces of art. Try it [HERE](https://github.com/MtnViewJohn/context-free).
